# Hangman Game

This is a simple implementation of the Hangman game in assembly language.

## Game Description

The Hangman game is a word guessing game. The player must try to guess the correct word by suggesting letters. With each incorrect guess, a part of a hangman figure is drawn. The player wins if they guess the word correctly before the hangman figure is completed, and loses if the figure is completed before guessing the word.

## Game Instructions

1. Run the game executable.
2. The game will display a blank word with underscores representing each letter.
3. Enter a letter by pressing a key on the keyboard.
4. If the letter is present in the word, it will be revealed in the correct position(s).
5. If the letter is not present in the word, a part of the hangman figure will be drawn.
6. Continue guessing letters until you either guess the word correctly or the hangman figure is completed.
7. The game will indicate if you win or lose.
8. Press the spacebar to start a new game.
